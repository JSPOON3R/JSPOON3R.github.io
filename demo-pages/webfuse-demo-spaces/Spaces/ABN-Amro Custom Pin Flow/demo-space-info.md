# Use Case
This is the standard pin escalation flow. Best for interactions where Customer and Agent are already on the phone. The Customer clicks a button and relays the pin code to the Agent. The Agent then joins the inbound session from the Studio dashboard with the same pin.

# ICP
Support/Sales flows with existing telephony set up. They'll be looking for an easy way to add co-browsing to an existing flow. This slots nicely into established workflows and requires minimal training for adoption.
